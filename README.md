This program is an interactive game where the computer generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it.

How it works:

The program randomly selects a number within a predefined range (e.g., 1–100).

The user is prompted to enter their guess.

The program compares the guess to the generated number and provides feedback:

Too high – if the guess is greater than the number.

Too low – if the guess is smaller than the number.

The process repeats until the user guesses the correct number.

Once guessed correctly, the program displays the number of attempts taken to win.

Features:

Random number generation for a unique game each time.

Real-time feedback to guide the player.

Tracks the total attempts to encourage replayability.

Example Gameplay:

Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 50  
Too high! Try again.  
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 25  
Too low! Try again.  
Guess the number (between 1 and 100): 37  
Congratulations! You guessed it in 3 attempts.
